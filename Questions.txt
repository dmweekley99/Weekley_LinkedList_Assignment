Question 1:
    Given a singly linked list, find the middle of the linked list. For example, if the given linked list is 1->2->3-
    >4->5 then the output should be 3. If there are even nodes, then there would be two middle nodes, we 
    need to print the second middle element. For example, if given linked list is 1->2->3->4->5->6 then the 
    output should be 4.

    Pseudocode (Brute Force Method): 
    Initialize "count" variable
    FOR item in linked_list:
        count += 1
    new_count = integer value of count/2
    print value of the linked_list at new_count variable


Question 2:
    Write a pseudo code for a function that clones a linked list. By taking a singly linked list and returning a 
    complete copy of that list.

    Pseudocode:
    Initialize current variable = head
    Initialize new_list variable = None
    Initialize follow variable = None
    WHILE current is not None:
        IF new_list is empty:
            set new_list = Node(current.data)
            set follow = new_list
        ELSE:
            set follow.next = Node(current.data)
            set follow = follow.next 
        set current = currunt.next
    RETURN new_list
